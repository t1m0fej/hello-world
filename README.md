# hello-world

First repository ever.

Changed shit bcuz they say i have to commit shit, so I can see what the actual fuck git is good for.
-> I'm working alone atm.
Isn't floobits for IntelliJ nearly the same shit?
well i don't think so, cuz you don't see that timeline/branch shit and the development the product was going thru.
I'm still a shitty as coder trying to figure out what purpose he has in life. kek.
Why do i have to pay shit to keep thing private, git? Why? I'm a FUCKING SUTDENT I'm not that wealthy you greedy fuks.
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY??
